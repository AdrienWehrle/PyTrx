# Example drivers for PyTrx
This folder contains example applications of PyTrx. Specifically it contains script drivers and the associated data with these examples. These can easily be adapted to different datasets and applications.<br>

<b>driver_velocity.py</b>
<br>Example driver for deriving velocities from Kronebreen Camera 2 over the 2014 melt season. This script uses images from those found in the 'KR2_2014_subset' folder, and camera environment data associated with the text file 'CameraEnvironmentData_cam2_2014.txt'.<br>

<b>driver_autoarea.py</b>
<br>Example driver for deriving changes in surface area of supraglacial lakes captured from Kronebreen Camera 5 over the 2014 melt season. Regions of interest are automatically detected based on differences in pixel intensity. This script uses images from those found in the 'KR5_2014_subset' folder, and camera environment data associated with the text file 'CameraEnvironmentData_cam5_2014.txt.'
